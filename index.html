    <p>Hi, I’m Jane Smith and I write TransitionMomBlog (who Jane is) to help women make 
        the transition from full-time mom to successful entrepreneur (the reader’s problem 
        or goal).Align I started TransitionMomBlog in 2004 (Jane’s expertise – shows she has been
        blogging for two years) to help other women deal with the sometimes overwhelming prospect
        of starting a new business while still running a household (how Jane helps them overcome
        their problem or achieve their goal). Prior to raising my family, I spent over ten years
        as a teacher, corporate trainer and workshop leader (Jane’s expertise, both as a mom and
         a business person). To contact me, please email XXX (how to contact Jane).</p>
